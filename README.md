Navigation Inside the Program
- Size can be passed as a parameter when you run either program to specify size of the linked list. A default linked list would be created of the size specified and would have elements starting from 1 to that size. If size is not provided, the default value would be 10. 

- In SinglyLinkedList.java, once you run the program, enter  
'1' into the console to proceed forward in the linked list and  
'2' to remove an element.  

- Similarly, in DoublyLinkedList.java, enter   
'1' into the console to move forward in the linked list,   
'2' to remove the current element,  
'3' to move to the previous element and  
'4' to add a new element in the list.
